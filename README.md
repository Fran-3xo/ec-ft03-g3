This is a student project we made as part of our education at [Soy Henry](https://www.soyhenry.com/), which consisted of creating a full-stack React application from scratch.

## Our stack of technologies:
- Front End:
    + HTML - CSS - Javascript
    + React
    + React-Bootstrap
    + React-MaterialUi
    + Redux

- Back End:
    + Node.js
    + Express
    + Passport
    + Sequelize

- Database: 
    + PostgreSQL

    # How to start the project:

If you want to see the page for yourself, you'll need to do the following:

- Clone the repository
- Create a `.env` file in the `client` folder with the following contents: 
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3005
```
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your computer and create a database called `development`.
- Create a `.env` file in in the `api` folder with the following contents:
```
DB_USER={Your postgreSQL user}
DB_PASSWORD={Your postgreSQL password}
DB_HOST=localhost

```

The app doesn't have any products or users created by default, you'll have to add them yourself! In order to do so, you'll have to log in as an admin.

```
To manage the page you must create a user that contains the mail: admin@admin.com.
To entry like User you can create an account random.
```
